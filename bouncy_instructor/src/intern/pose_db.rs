//! Types and code for keeping a list of poses to detect across method calls.
//!
//! Poses are defined with regard to a list of limb definitions, in order to
//! avoid storing the limb definitions repeatedly. The downside is that each
//! data set (one data set per video frame) on its own lacks context. You have
//! to combine it with the list of poses. This module contains the context
//!  structs required for this.
