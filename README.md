# Open-Source Commitment

## License

This project is developed under permissive licenses. You may freely reuse the
code for your own projects. If you do, I would love to hear about it. Open an
issue, say hello and describe your project. Or drop me a private message. Of
course, there is no obligation to do so but I would appreciate it.

For exact licensing details, please refer to the license files. There are
multiple licenses available to choose from, just to give you more options and
have this code fit better in your project. If you find the licenses available
unsuitable for your project, please open an issue.

## Contribution

The current status is **source available** without explicit encouragement for
external contributions. I am happy to answer pull requests and issues but please
set your expectation right, there can be delays.

Hopefully, the project will mature to a point where external contribution is
actively encouraged. But at this state of the project, there is not enough
stable code in the repository to justify collaboration with strangers, which
always comes with an overhead.
